Burnside's lemma - Cube 

Burnside's lemma, sometimes also called Burnside's counting theorem, the Cauchyâ€“Frobenius lemma, 
orbit-counting theorem, or The Lemma that is not Burnside's, is a result in group theory which is 
often useful in taking account of symmetry when counting mathematical objects. 

The number of rotationally distinct colorings of the faces of a cube in n colors is given by 
'result' below.
